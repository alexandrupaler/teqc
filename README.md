# tqec geometry generator

Software for generating a geometric description corresponding to 
a TQEC circuit.


Note March 2018: Current commit does not generate geometries. Use previous commit for that.
This one is to benchmark the performance of wire label reference diagrams.

Please reference http://www.nature.com/articles/srep30600 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08621) if you use the software.

To use it:

1) make

2) have a look in the visual folder (visual/localscript.sh)
